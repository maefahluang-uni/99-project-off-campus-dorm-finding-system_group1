Off Campus Dorm Finding System Project (Name: ComfyNest)
=============
Description:
    This app is designed to help students who are far from their home to find dormitories outside the university with high transparency, reliability and, efficiency.
    By the request of our stakeholder, we only implemented the tenent(student) side of the app. In the app, the tenent will be able to rate, keep wishlist, and find dorms based on their names or city.
